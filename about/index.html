<h2>Who are we?</h2>

<p class="lede">At it's heart - Qoppa is a group of developers who love what we do every single day. We are passionate about art and technology. We love making new discoveries and solving problems.</p>

  <li>
    <h4>Collaboration</h4>
    <p>We have all worked together in one capacity or another outside of Qoppa. We chose to continue working together. We are friends. We work well together because we know how great our products are when we collaborate and use our individual talents collectively. Kind of like a big nerdy Transformer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Accountability</h4>
    <p>We expect more out of each other because we know how important 'doing it right' is for our success, both individually and as a company.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>We push ourselves to improve with everything we do. Developers can be a competitive sort; we use that competitiveness to motivate each other to create something not previously done - to make our customers say 'Wow!'</p>
