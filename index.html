    <h2>Strategy</h2>
    <p><strong>Web Design &amp; Development is art.</strong> In order to create a great website, copywriting, typography, layout, and graphic design must be combined together to create a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing experience. This doesn't happen by accident.</p>

    <p>We provide a concise, clear direction to combine all of the best things about you and/or your business to create that experience. Many websites can look great and achieve nothing. Conversely, there are some very unattractive websites that find a good amount of success. The sweet spot is a symphony of those two creations. We start every project with a strategy meeting with you to find out your top goals and objectives. We plan, and then plan some more - <em>measure twice, cut once</em> ain't just for sewing and carpentry.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>Web Design isn't just about looks; it's about how your site is intended to be used. If it looks cool, but no one knows how to find the inforamtion they're after - it's a bad design. With 10+ years of design user experiences, we know how to drive your visitors to the content they want, and how to cut paths that lead them to the content that you want. A website designed to work as well on their phone as it is on their desktop.</p>

    <p>Qoppa specializes in Responsive Web Design. We have built <strong>Responsive and Adaptive Website Designs</strong> for customers from all ends of the spectrum -- Large, enterprise-level corporations, startups, and small Mom &amp; Pop shops.</p>

    <p>We can do the same for you.</p>
